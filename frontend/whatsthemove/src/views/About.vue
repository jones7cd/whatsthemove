          <h2>Hello, welcome to What's the Move?! We are just a few college students who are dedicated to letting the world know that Finnegan's Cove has happy hour from 2-9 pm, or should I say happy hours... LOL! I guess we are also interested in other local hotspots around town too, so please take a look to find out "What's the Move?!"</h2>
